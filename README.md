This repository stores some of the Power BI projects that I've worked on.

## Sales Insights Dashboard for a Computer Hardware supplier
The project is based on the tutorial posted on the [codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9nVJoWXmFb7sLApWGcLPQ) YouTube channel. The following are the project details -
 
1. The supplier has data on the transactions for supplies to various stores across India and wants to know the unlock insights that may not be directly infered from manual communications.
2. An **automated dashboard** to provide insights and make data driven decisions is the **desirable deliverable** from this project.
3. Sourced the data from tutorial's dump and performed data cleaning and transformation steps in PBI.
4. Created a dashboard showing overall revenue, sales quantity, revenue distribution by market, sales distribution my market, top five customers and products by revenue. With additional filters for year and month. Also included a line chart of the revenue trend.
